## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Select Relevant Personas**: Choose personas that align with your project needs
2. **Understand Rulesets**: Familiarize yourself with RFC2119 requirements for each persona
3. **Establish Collaboration**: Implement communication and feedback loops between personas
4. **Set Up Human-AI Processes**: Establish explicit agreement protocols and review processes
5. **Document Everything**: Maintain records of decisions, conflicts, and resolutions
6. **Regular Retrospectives**: Assess framework effectiveness and make adjustments

### Best Practices
1. **Role-Based Focus**: Concentrate on personas relevant to your specific work
2. **RFC2119 Compliance**: Strictly adhere to MUST/SHOULD/MAY/MUST NOT requirements
