## Key Components

### 1. Agents Directory
- Contains 40+ AI agent persona files organized by function
- Each agent has a specific role with RFC2119-based rulesets
- Files follow naming convention: `[function]-[role].md`

### 2. .perseus Directory
- Contains project artifacts following the Human-AI software delivery process
- Includes OUTCOMES.yaml, PLAN.md, ADRs/, RUNBOOK.md, etc.

### 3. Core Documentation
- README.md - Main project documentation
- HATS.md - AI compliance requirements
- GUARDRAILS.md - Quality and security standards
- PROCESS.md - Human-AI collaboration process
- RFC2119.md - RFC 2119 requirements reference
- PURPOSE.md - Project purpose and goals

## Files That Can Be Cleaned Up

The following files were used during the development process and can be removed:

1. `API_CONSOLIDATION_EXAMPLE.md` - Development artifact
2. `COMPLETE_FILE_INVENTORY.md` - Development artifact
3. `COMPLETE_PERSONAS_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
4. `COMPLETE_STRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
5. `CONSOLIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Development artifact
6. `CREATION_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
7. `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - Development artifact
8. `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
9. `HATS_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
10. `HATS_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Development artifact
11. `HATS_Framework.md` - Development artifact
12. `HATS_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Development artifact
13. `HATS_IMPLEMENTATION_FINAL_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Development artifact
14. `HATS_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Development artifact
15. `ROLES_AND_AI_COORDINATION.md` - Development artifact
16. `agents_roles_list.md` - Development artifact
17. `hello_world_python_agent_communications.md` - Development artifact
18. `persona_to_agent_conversion_summary.md` - Development artifact
19. `persona_to_agent_mapping.md` - Development artifact
20. `persona_to_agent_mapping_corrected.md` - Development artifact
21. `persona_to_agent_mapping_final.md` - Development artifact
22. `skill.matrix.roles.md` - Empty file

## Recommended Cleanup Actions

1. Remove all development/summary files listed above
2. Keep core documentation files (README.md, HATS.md, GUARDRAILS.md, PROCESS.md, RFC2119.md, PURPOSE.md)
3. Keep the .perseus directory as it contains project artifacts
4. Keep the agents directory as it contains the AI personas
5. Keep the scripts directory as it contains utility scripts

## Final Structure

After cleanup, the directory should contain:
- Core documentation files
- .perseus directory with project artifacts
- agents directory with AI persona files
- scripts directory with utility scripts
