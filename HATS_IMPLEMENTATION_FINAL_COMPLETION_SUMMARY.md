3. ✅ Created the collaboration model between personas
4. ✅ Developed the Human-AI interaction framework
5. ✅ Implemented the domain consolidation approach
6. ✅ Created detailed RFC2119-compliant profiles for all 32 personas
7. ✅ Consolidated all domain-specific requirements into persona profiles
8. ✅ Eliminated redundant domain directories
9. ✅ Centralized information in role-based persona profiles
10. ✅ Maintained RFC2119 compliance across all consolidated content

The framework provides a robust foundation for Human-AI collaborative software development that leverages the strengths of both humans and AI while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities. By defining distinct personas with specific rulesets and collaboration patterns, and consolidating all domain-specific information into persona profiles, the framework enables more effective teamwork and higher quality outcomes.

With the completion of the content migration and directory cleanup, the HATS framework provides an integrated, efficient, and effective approach to Human-AI teamwork in software development.
