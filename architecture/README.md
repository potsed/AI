# Architecture Guardrails

This directory contains guardrails specific to software architecture practices and patterns.

## Key Documents

- **ARCHITECTURAL_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md** - Comprehensive guide to architectural design patterns, their uses, and when they should be applied
- **RFC2119_ARCHITECTURE.md** - RFC 2119 requirements for architectural design patterns

## Purpose

These guardrails ensure that software architecture decisions are consistent, scalable, maintainable, and aligned with industry best practices. They cover various architectural patterns, design principles, and implementation guidelines.

## Usage

All guardrails in this directory are subject to the AI Mandatory Compliance requirements defined in the root AI.md file. Each document uses RFC2119 language (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) to define requirements.

For general information about the HI/AI Policies framework, please see the root README.md file.
