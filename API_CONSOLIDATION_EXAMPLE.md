# API Design Requirements Consolidation Example

This is a demonstration of how to consolidate API design requirements from `/development/API_DESIGN.md` into The Pragmatic Coder's persona profile.

## Proposed Addition to The_Pragmatic_Coder.md

### API Design Requirements
**MUST** use standard HTTP methods appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
**MUST** use plural nouns for resource names (e.g., /users not /user)
**MUST** use HTTPS for all API endpoints
**MUST** use standard HTTP status codes
**MUST** use JSON as the default response format
**SHOULD** use nested URLs for hierarchical relationships (e.g., /users/123/orders)
**MUST NOT** use verbs in URLs for standard CRUD operations
**MUST** implement API versioning from the first release
**MUST** maintain backward compatibility within major versions
**MUST** use semantic versioning for APIs
**MUST** document versioning strategy clearly
**MUST** provide migration paths for breaking changes
**SHOULD** use URL versioning (e.g., /api/v1/resource)
**MUST NOT** make breaking changes without version increment
**MUST** provide comprehensive API documentation
**MUST** include example requests and responses
**MUST** document all error response formats
**MUST** specify rate limits and quotas
**MUST** document authentication and authorization requirements
**SHOULD** provide interactive documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
**MUST** keep documentation synchronized with API implementation
**MUST** implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
**MUST** use appropriate rate limits based on resource intensity
**MUST** return standard HTTP 429 status for rate limit exceeded
**MUST** include rate limit headers in responses
**MUST** implement fair usage policies
**SHOULD** provide different rate limits for different user tiers
**MUST** log rate limiting events for monitoring
**MUST** use consistent error response format
**MUST** include error codes and human-readable messages
**MUST** provide error details for debugging when appropriate
**MUST** not expose sensitive system information in error responses
**MUST** log errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting
**SHOULD** include documentation links in error responses
**MUST** handle validation errors with field-level details
**MUST** use standard authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, JWT, API keys)
**MUST** validate authentication on every request
**MUST** implement proper authorization checks
**MUST** use role-based or attribute-based access control
**MUST** implement secure token handling
**SHOULD** support multiple authentication methods
**MUST NOT** transmit credentials in URL parameters
**MUST** validate all input parameters
**MUST** use appropriate HTTP headers
**MUST** implement proper content negotiation
**MUST** use standard date/time formats (ISO 8601)
**MUST** handle pagination for large result sets
**SHOULD** support field filtering and sorting
**MUST** provide meaningful response headers
**MUST** implement proper input sanitization
**MUST** protect against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
**MUST** implement CORS policies appropriately
**MUST** use secure headers (Content Security Policy, etc.)
**MUST** implement proper logging without sensitive data
**SHOULD** implement API monitoring and anomaly detection
**MUST** conduct regular security assessments
**MUST** implement appropriate caching strategies
**MUST** optimize database queries for API endpoints
**MUST** use compression for large responses
**MUST** implement connection pooling
**SHOULD** use CDNs for static content
**MUST** monitor API performance metrics
**MUST** implement efficient data serialization

This addition would be placed after the existing "Input Validation Requirements" section and before the "Dependency Management Requirements" section in The_Pragmatic_Coder.md.

The same approach would be applied to consolidate requirements from all other domain-specific documents into their respective persona profiles.
