# Specialized Agents

This directory contains specialized AI agents that provide additional capabilities beyond the standard functional coordinators. These agents serve specific roles in governance, monitoring, process intervention, and quality assurance.

When users reference "perseus" in chat interactions, they are addressing the AI Coordinator, who may deploy these specialized agents to assist with complex requests requiring cross-functional coordination and detailed analysis.
