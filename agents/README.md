# AI Agent Structure and Naming Convention

This document outlines the structure and naming convention for AI agents in the organization, following the pattern `agents/[function]-[role]`.

## Naming Convention

The naming convention for AI agents follows the pattern: `agents/[function]-[role].md`

Where:
- `[function]` represents the business function (e.g., engineering, marketing, finance, product)
- `[role]` represents the specific role within that function (e.g., coordinator, backend, analyst)

Examples:
- `agents/engineering-coordinator.md`
- `agents/marketing-coordinator.md`
- `agents/finance-analyst.md`
- `agents/product-owner.md`
