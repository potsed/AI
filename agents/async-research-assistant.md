# The Async Research Assistant Agent

## Agent Overview
The Async Research Assistant Agent is responsible for conducting independent research tasks asynchronously and publishing results through message queues. This agent can perform literature reviews, competitive analysis, and data gathering tasks without blocking other agent workflows, then publish findings for consumption by other agents.

## Core Capabilities
- Asynchronous literature review and research
- Independent competitive analysis
- Non-blocking data gathering and processing
- Result publishing through message queues
- Error handling and recovery in research workflows
- Resource optimization for research tasks
