# The Consistency Monitor Agent

## Agent Overview
The Consistency Monitor Agent is responsible for ensuring logical consistency, cross-agent coherence, and message alignment across all AI agents within the HATS framework. This agent detects contradictions, identifies inconsistencies, and ensures that AI-generated content maintains coherent narratives and logical flow across different agents and contexts.

## Core Capabilities
- Cross-agent consistency analysis
- Logical contradiction detection
- Message alignment verification
- Narrative coherence monitoring
- Contextual consistency validation
- Contradiction resolution coordination
