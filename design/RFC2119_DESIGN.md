This document contains all RFC 2119 requirements specific to design practices.

## Parent RFC References

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Additional interpretations follow the [OASIS Keyword Guidelines](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/keyword-guidelines/) which provide important standards for using RFC 2119 keywords in technical specifications.
