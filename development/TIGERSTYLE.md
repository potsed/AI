# Tigerstyle.dev Principles

This document describes the principles and practices from tigerstyle.dev for efficient and effective software development.

## Core Principles

### Exit Early Principle
**Description**: Minimize unnecessary processing by exiting or returning as soon as possible when conditions are met or constraints are violated.
**When to Use**: For all code where early termination can prevent unnecessary computation or processing.
**Benefits**:
- Better performance with reduced processing overhead
- Improved readability with clearer control flow
- Better error handling with immediate failure response
- Enhanced maintainability with simpler logic
- Better resource utilization with early release

**Drawbacks**:
- Can complicate some complex conditional logic
- May require careful consideration of side effects
- Can make debugging more difficult in some cases
- Requires discipline to implement consistently

**Implementation Guidelines**:
1. **Validate inputs early**: Check preconditions and input validity at the beginning of functions
2. **Fail fast**: Return or throw exceptions immediately when constraints are violated
3. **Use guard clauses**: Implement early returns for exceptional conditions
4. **Minimize nested conditionals**: Use early exits to reduce nesting levels
5. **Return default values early**: Set default values and override only when necessary
6. **Short-circuit evaluation**: Use logical operators that stop evaluation when result is determined
7. **Early resource cleanup**: Release resources as soon as they're no longer needed
8. **Implement proper error handling**: Handle errors immediately when detected
9. **Use appropriate assertions**: Implement assertions to catch programming errors early
10. **Document early exit conditions**: Clearly document why and when early exits occur

### Guard Clause Pattern
**Description**: Using early returns to handle exceptional cases and simplify main logic flow.
**When to Use**: When functions have multiple exceptional conditions that should be handled immediately.
**Benefits**:
- Better readability with reduced nesting
- Improved maintainability with clearer logic flow
- Better error handling with immediate response
- Enhanced testability with isolated conditions
- Better performance with early termination

**Drawbacks**:
- Can complicate some complex conditional logic
- May require careful consideration of side effects
- Can make debugging more difficult in some cases
- Requires discipline to implement consistently

**Implementation Guidelines**:
1. **Check preconditions first**: Validate inputs and state before main logic
2. **Handle error cases immediately**: Return or throw exceptions for invalid conditions
3. **Use clear condition names**: Make guard clause conditions self-documenting
4. **Keep guard clauses simple**: Avoid complex logic in guard clauses
5. **Order guard clauses logically**: Place most common or cheapest checks first
6. **Document guard clause rationale**: Explain why each guard clause exists
7. **Use consistent formatting**: Apply consistent style to all guard clauses
8. **Test guard clauses separately**: Ensure each guard clause is properly tested
9. **Avoid side effects in guard clauses**: Keep guard clauses pure when possible
10. **Consider combining related conditions**: Group related guard clauses when appropriate

### Assertion Usage
**Description**: Using assertions to catch programming errors and document assumptions in code.
**When to Use**: For documenting assumptions and catching programming errors during development.
**Benefits**:
- Better debugging with immediate error detection
- Improved documentation with explicit assumptions

- Requires discipline to implement consistently

**Implementation Guidelines**:
1. **Assert preconditions**: Check function input assumptions
2. **Assert postconditions**: Verify function output expectations
3. **Assert invariants**: Check conditions that should always be true
4. **Use clear assertion messages**: Provide meaningful error messages
5. **Document assertion rationale**: Explain why each assertion exists
6. **Test assertions**: Ensure assertions catch expected errors
7. **Disable assertions in production**: Use proper build configurations
8. **Use appropriate assertion libraries**: Leverage language-specific tools
9. **Avoid expensive assertions**: Keep assertions lightweight
10. **Consider assertion levels**: Use different assertion severities when appropriate

### Separation of Concerns
**Description**: Dividing a program into distinct sections where each section addresses a separate concern.
**When to Use**: For all software design to improve modularity and maintainability.
**Benefits**:
- Better maintainability with isolated changes
- Improved testability with focused testing
- Better reusability with modular components
- Enhanced scalability with independent scaling
- Better collaboration with team specialization

**Drawbacks**:
- Can increase initial design complexity

2. **Create clear boundaries**: Define explicit interfaces between concerns
3. **Minimize coupling**: Reduce dependencies between separate concerns
4. **Maximize cohesion**: Keep related functionality together
5. **Use appropriate patterns**: Apply design patterns for separation
6. **Document concern boundaries**: Clearly define responsibility divisions
7. **Test concerns independently**: Isolate testing for each concern
8. **Implement proper abstractions**: Use interfaces and abstract classes
9. **Avoid cross-cutting concerns**: Handle logging, security, etc. systematically
10. **Maintain separation discipline**: Resist temptation to mix concerns

### Default Value Patterns
**Description**: Setting sensible defaults and overriding them only when necessary.
**When to Use**: For all configuration, initialization, and conditional logic scenarios.
**Benefits**:
- Better readability with clear default assumptions

5. **Test default behavior**: Ensure defaults work correctly
6. **Consider user expectations**: Align defaults with user assumptions
7. **Use configuration for defaults**: Externalize defaults when appropriate
8. **Implement proper override mechanisms**: Provide clear override paths
9. **Validate overridden values**: Check that overrides are valid
10. **Log default usage**: Track when defaults are used vs. overrides

### Early Return Pattern

**Implementation Guidelines**:
1. **Use && for conjunctions**: Stop evaluation when first false condition is found
2. **Use || for disjunctions**: Stop evaluation when first true condition is found
3. **Place cheap conditions first**: Put inexpensive checks before expensive ones
4. **Place likely conditions first**: Put most probable conditions early
5. **Avoid side effects in conditions**: Keep conditional expressions pure
6. **Document evaluation order**: Explain why conditions are ordered a certain way
7. **Test short-circuit behavior**: Ensure logic works correctly with early termination
8. **Use appropriate operators**: Choose operators that support short-circuiting
9. **Consider performance implications**: Evaluate cost of each condition
10. **Maintain logical correctness**: Ensure short-circuiting doesn't change semantics

### Resource Management
**Description**: Acquiring and releasing resources as early as possible to minimize usage.
**When to Use**: For all resource-intensive operations and limited resources.
**Benefits**:

4. **Implement proper cleanup**: Ensure resources are always released
5. **Use try-finally or using statements**: Guarantee cleanup execution
6. **Document resource usage**: Explain why and how resources are used
7. **Test resource management**: Ensure resources are properly acquired and released
8. **Monitor resource usage**: Track resource consumption and leaks
9. **Use resource pools**: Reuse resources when appropriate
10. **Consider resource limits**: Respect system and application resource constraints

## Implementation Examples

### Early Return vs Nested Conditions

Instead of:
```javascript
function processUser(user) {
    if (user !== null) {
        if (user.isActive) {
            if (user.hasPermission) {
                // Main logic here
                return performAction(user);
            } else {
                return "Insufficient permissions";
            }
        } else {
            return "User not active";
        }
    } else {
        return "User not found";
    }
}
```

Use:
```javascript
function processUser(user) {
    if (user === null) {
        return "User not found";
    }
    
    if (!user.isActive) {
        return "User not active";
    }
    
    if (!user.hasPermission) {
        return "Insufficient permissions";
    }
    
    // Main logic here
    return performAction(user);
}
```

### Default Values Pattern

Instead of:
```javascript
let x;
if (a === true) {
    x = "something";
} else {
    x = "something else";
}
```

Use:
```javascript
let x = "something else"; // Default assumption
if (a) {
    x = "something";
}
```

Or with ternary operator:
```javascript
let x = a ? "something" : "something else";
```

### Guard Clauses

Instead of:
```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b !== 0) {
        if (typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number') {
            return a / b;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Invalid types");
        }
    } else {
        throw new Error("Division by zero");
    }
}
```

Use:
```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Division by zero");
    }
    
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        throw new Error("Invalid types");
    }
    
    return a / b;
}
```

### Assertion Usage

```javascript
function calculateDiscount(price, discountPercent) {
    // Precondition assertions
    console.assert(typeof price === 'number', "Price must be a number");
    console.assert(typeof discountPercent === 'number', "Discount percent must be a number");
    console.assert(price >= 0, "Price must be non-negative");
    console.assert(discountPercent >= 0 && discountPercent <= 100, "Discount percent must be between 0 and 100");
    
    const discountAmount = price * (discountPercent / 100);
    const finalPrice = price - discountAmount;
    
    // Postcondition assertion
    console.assert(finalPrice >= 0, "Final price must be non-negative");
    
    return finalPrice;
}
```

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

```javascript
// Instead of:
if (user !== null && user.isActive && user.hasPermission('read')) {
    // Process user
}

// Or with expensive operations:
if (user !== null && user.isActive && checkDatabasePermission(user, 'read')) {
    // Process user
}

// Early return with short-circuit:
if (!user?.isActive || !checkDatabasePermission(user, 'read')) {
    return;
}
// Process user
```
