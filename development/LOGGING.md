# Logging Design Patterns

This document describes all major logging design patterns, their uses, and when they should be applied.

## Fundamentals of Logging

### What Is Logging?

Logging is the practice of recording events, messages, and data during the execution of an application. It serves multiple purposes:

- **Debugging**: Helping developers identify and fix issues
- **Auditing**: Tracking user actions and system changes
- **Monitoring**: Observing system health and performance
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for data handling
- **Analytics**: Understanding user behavior and system usage
- **Forensics**: Investigating security incidents and system failures

### Core Concepts

#### Log Levels
The standard log levels, defined by the Syslog protocol, are:

- **TRACE**: Extremely detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information on the flow through the system. May be ignored during normal operation
- **INFO**: Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). The default minimum logging level
- **WARN**: Warning events might cause problems in the future. Indicate that an error will not necessarily occur
- **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running
- **FATAL**: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort

#### Log Structure
A well-structured log entry typically includes:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Level**: Severity of the event
- **Source**: Where the event originated (class, method, file, line)
- **Message**: Human-readable description of the event
- **Context**: Additional data relevant to the event
- **Correlation ID**: Identifier to correlate related log entries
- **Session ID**: Identifier to correlate user sessions
- **Thread ID**: Identifier for multi-threaded applications
- **Host Information**: Information about the system where the event occurred

## Logging Patterns

### Structured Logging Pattern

#### Description
Structured logging involves logging data in a structured format (typically JSON) that can be easily parsed and analyzed by machines.

#### When to Use
- Applications requiring log analysis and search

#### Implementation Guidelines
1. Define consistent JSON schema for log entries
2. Include standard fields (timestamp, level, message) in every log entry
3. Add application-specific context fields as needed
4. Use appropriate data types for all fields
5. Implement proper error handling for malformed JSON
6. Consider compression for large log volumes
7. Monitor and optimize structured log performance
