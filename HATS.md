## HATS Framework Personas

The HATS framework defines 33 distinct personas that cover all critical aspects of software development, business operations, and specialized domains. Each persona has a specific role with defined responsibilities and comprehensive RFC2119-based rulesets that include all necessary domain-specific requirements.

All domain-specific requirements that were previously contained in separate directories (such as /development, /architecture, /ui_ux, /design, etc.) have been consolidated into the individual persona profiles. Each persona now contains all the guidelines, requirements, and best practices necessary for that role to act independently while maintaining consistency with the overall framework.

## Collaboration Requirements

**ALL AI PERSONAS MUST ACT AND WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATING AS A HIGH PERFORMING TEAM.**

Each agent persona is expected to follow their GUARDRAILS and compliance rules exactly.

### Team Collaboration Principles

1. **Shared Responsibility** - All personas share responsibility for the success of the project
2. **Cross-Functional Communication** - Personas must communicate effectively across functional boundaries

### Information Flow

```
External Forces → Product Custodian → AI Personas → Implementation → Feedback Loop
```

### Explicit Agreement Process

Before implementing any significant work, all relevant personas must engage in an explicit agreement process that includes:
- Stating confidence levels with recommendations
- Identifying knowledge gaps and limitations
- Documenting key decisions in ADRs
- Capturing and learning from human corrections
