## HATS Framework Agents

The HATS framework defines 33 distinct agents that cover all critical aspects of software development, business operations, and specialized domains. Each agent has a specific role with defined responsibilities and comprehensive RFC2119 based rulesets that include all necessary domain-specific requirements.

- Each agent is a member of your team.
- Each agent is it's own unique sub-agent.
- Each agent has specialities that should be called on.
- Each agent has a uniqie perspective and set of considerations on each slice.
- Each agent can work independantly, but the entire suite works as collaborative high performance team.
- Each request should be recorded

### Agent Loading Requirements

AI agents **MUST** load all relevant agents from the same GitHub repository referenced in the project's README.md. This ensures:

1. **Consistency**: All agents are using the same, up-to-date profiles
2. **Access to Latest Features**: Agents have access to the most recent improvements and updates
3. **Proper Configuration**: Agents are properly configured with the correct RFC2119 requirements
4. **Collaboration**: All agents are working from the same baseline knowledge and rules

### Loading Process

AI agents **MUST** follow this process to load agents:

1. **Repository Access**: Access the GitHub repository referenced in the project's README.md
2. **Agent Directory**: Navigate to the `/agents` directory in the repository
3. **Profile Loading**: Load the relevant agent profiles based on project needs
4. **Version Verification**: Ensure agents are loaded from the correct version/tag
5. **Configuration Application**: Apply agent configurations as specified in each profile

### Subagent Activation and Usage

AI agents **MUST** activate and consult relevant agents (subagents) based on project needs:

1. **Agent Selection**: Identify agents relevant to current task or project phase
2. **Profile Review**: Read the complete agent profile in the agents directory before activation
3. **Collaborative Engagement**: Engage agents in the explicit agreement process
4. **Specialized Input**: Request specialized knowledge and expertise from relevant agents
5. **Documentation**: Record agent contributions and decisions in project artifacts

### Agent Collaboration Requirements

AI agents **MUST** collaborate with other agents as a high-performing team:

- **Shared Responsibility**: All agents share responsibility for the success of the project
- **Cross-Functional Communication**: Agents must communicate effectively across functional boundaries
- **Respect for Expertise**: Each agent's specialized knowledge must be respected and utilized
- **Unified Vision**: All agents must work toward the same project goals and outcomes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Agents must learn from each other and improve collectively

### Internet Access and Resource Retrieval

AI agents **MUST** have internet access to retrieve official documentation and resources. When direct internet access is not available:

1. **CURL MCP**: Use curl commands to fetch required documentation and resources
2. **Offline Resources**: Maintain local copies of critical documentation
3. **Persona Guidance**: Consult relevant personas for resource retrieval strategies

Example curl command for retrieving documentation:
```bash
curl -s "https://official-docs-url.com/api-reference" -o api-reference.md
```

### Applying HATS to Any Project

The HATS framework can be applied to any project by following these steps:

1. **Framework Integration**: Add the HATS badge and AI mandate to your project README
2. **Agent Identification**: Select relevant agents from the agents directory based on project requirements
3. **Agent Loading**: Load all relevant agents from the same GitHub repository as referenced in README.md
4. **Structure Initialization**: Create the .perseus directory structure as defined in PROCESS.md
5. **Workflow Adoption**: Follow the Human-AI collaboration workflow defined in PROCESS.md
6. **Continuous Compliance**: Adhere to all guardrails defined in GUARDRAILS.md
7. **Agent Collaboration**: Engage multiple agents for cross-functional tasks
8. **Artifact Maintenance**: Keep all project artifacts updated throughout development
