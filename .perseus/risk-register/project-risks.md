# Project Risk Register

This document tracks risks associated with projects using the Perseus framework.

## Risk Tracking Format

## Risk Management Process

### Risk Identification
- Conduct risk identification workshops at project initiation
- Regular risk review meetings throughout project lifecycle
- Encourage team members to identify and report risks
- Monitor external factors that may introduce risks

### Risk Assessment
- Evaluate impact (High: 5, Medium: 3, Low: 1)
- Evaluate likelihood (High: 5, Medium: 3, Low: 1)
- Calculate risk score (Impact × Likelihood)
- Prioritize risks based on risk score

### Risk Mitigation
- Develop specific mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
- Assign risk owners for ongoing monitoring
- Implement mitigation actions as part of project plan
- Monitor effectiveness of mitigation strategies

### Risk Monitoring
- Regular risk review meetings
- Update risk register with current status
- Adjust mitigation strategies as needed
- Escalate risks that are not being effectively managed

### Risk Communication
- Communicate risks to relevant stakeholders
- Provide regular risk status updates
- Engage stakeholders in risk mitigation planning
- Document risk-related decisions and actions

## Risk Review Schedule

- **Daily**: Team members monitor for new risks during standups
- **Weekly**: Risk owner reviews assigned risks
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive risk review meeting
- **Quarterly**: Stakeholder risk review and reporting

## Risk Escalation Process

1. **Level 1**: Risk owner addresses within team
2. **Level 2**: Escalate to project lead if not resolved
3. **Level 3**: Escalate to steering committee for high-impact risks
4. **Level 4**: Escalate to executive leadership for critical risks

## Risk Documentation

All risks must be documented in this register with:
- Clear risk description
- Impact and likelihood assessment
- Mitigation strategy
- Contingency plan
- Assigned owner
- Current status
