# Domain-Specific Guardrail Implementation - Summary

## Work Completed

We have successfully implemented domain-specific guardrails for the HI/AI Policies framework, expanding coverage to ensure comprehensive guidance for AI contributors across all software development domains.

## Files Created

1. **DATABASE.md** - Mandatory requirements for database design, implementation, and management
2. **PERFORMANCE.md** - Mandatory performance requirements for all systems
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Architectural principles and patterns that must be followed
4. **DATA_PRIVACY.md** - Mandatory requirements for data privacy protection
5. **API_DESIGN.md** - Mandatory requirements for API design and implementation
6. **INFRASTRUCTURE.md** - Mandatory infrastructure requirements for all systems
7. **MAINTENANCE.md** - Mandatory requirements for system maintenance and sustainability
8. **COMPLIANCE.md** - Mandatory compliance requirements for all systems
9. **GUARDRAILS_BY_ROLE.md** - Organization of all guardrails by functional roles
10. **scripts/validate_guardrails.sh** - Script to validate guardrail document formatting
11. **.perseus/ADRs/0003-guardrail-domain-coverage.md** - ADR documenting the new guardrail domains

## Files Updated

1. **README.md** - Added descriptions of all new guardrail documents
2. **.perseus/PLAN.md** - Added new slices for domain-specific guardrail work
3. **PURPOSE.md** - Updated purpose to reflect expanded scope
4. **.perseus/OUTCOMES.yaml** - Updated progress to 40% for all outcomes

## Key Features

### Consistent Formatting
All new guardrail documents follow the same mandatory format:
- Explicit AI Mandatory Compliance section with RFC2119 language
- Clear MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT requirements
- Domain-specific coverage of essential topics

### Comprehensive Coverage
The new guardrails cover specialized areas that were previously not addressed:
- Database design and management
- Performance optimization
- System architecture principles
- Data privacy protection
- API design standards
- Infrastructure requirements
- System maintenance practices
- Compliance requirements

### Role-Based Organization
Created GUARDRAILS_BY_ROLE.md to organize all guardrails by functional roles:
- DEVELOPMENT, CODE_QUALITY, QA, UX, UI, DEVOPS, PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT, SECURITY
- DATABASE, PERFORMANCE, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_PRIVACY, API_DESIGN
- INFRASTRUCTURE, MAINTENANCE, COMPLIANCE

### Validation Tools
Created validation script to ensure consistency across all guardrail documents.

## Impact

This work significantly expands the HI/AI Policies framework to provide comprehensive guidance for AI contributors working in specialized domains, ensuring that all aspects of software development are covered by explicit, enforceable guardrails.
