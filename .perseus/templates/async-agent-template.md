# Async Agent Template

## Agent Overview
This is a template for creating asynchronous AI agents that can collaborate with other agents in non-blocking workflows. Async agents are designed to perform tasks independently, communicate through message queues, and coordinate with other agents without blocking workflows.

## Core Capabilities
- Asynchronous task execution
- Non-blocking communication
- Independent workflow processing
- Result publishing and subscription
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource optimization
