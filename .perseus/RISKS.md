## Risk Mitigation Details

### RISK-001 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set was initially missing detailed guidance for specialized domains.
**Mitigation**: Created domain-specific guardrails for DATABASE, PERFORMANCE, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_PRIVACY, API_DESIGN, INFRASTRUCTURE, MAINTENANCE, and COMPLIANCE. Organized guardrails by functional roles for easier navigation.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-002 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set did not cover important scenarios in specialized software development domains.
**Mitigation**: Expanded coverage to include comprehensive guardrails for all major software development domains, ensuring AI contributors have explicit guidance for specialized scenarios.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-005 - Mitigated
**Description**: The expanded guardrail set might lack sufficient depth in specialized domains due to insufficient domain expertise.
**Mitigation**: Created additional guardrails for TESTING, VERSION_CONTROL, CONTAINERIZATION, CLOUD, MICROSERVICES, APPLICATION_SECURITY, DATA_ENGINEERING, WEB, and CODE_REVIEW domains, providing comprehensive coverage across the software development landscape.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-006 - Mitigated
**Description**: With over 40 guardrail documents, the instruction set became difficult to navigate and maintain.
**Mitigation**: Restructured repository to organize guardrails by functional domains (development, marketing, design, hr, finance) with clear README files explaining each domain's purpose.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-007 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set did not fully comply with industry standards for technical specifications.
**Mitigation**: Implemented full compliance with RFC 2119 and OASIS Keyword Guidelines, ensuring all documents include proper conformance clauses and references. Created validation scripts to maintain compliance.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-PERSEUS-001 - Open
**Description**: Critical documentation for the Perseus initialization may be missing, inaccurate, or inconsistent with GUARDRAILS.md requirements.
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement peer review process for all documentation
- Use validation scripts to check compliance with GUARDRAILS.md
- Conduct regular documentation audits
- Maintain clear version control with Git
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open

### RISK-PERSEUS-002 - Open
**Description**: Implementation of the Perseus framework may deviate from HATS framework requirements, potentially causing rejected contributions.
**Mitigation**: 
- Regular review of HATS.md requirements during development
- Automated validation of RFC2119 compliance
- Explicit agreement process between human and AI contributors
- Quarterly compliance assessments
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open

### RISK-PERSEUS-003 - Open
**Description**: Miscommunication or lack of explicit agreement between human and AI contributors could lead to incorrect implementation during Perseus initialization.
**Mitigation**: 
- Establish clear communication protocols using the "perseus" alias
- Implement explicit agreement processes before implementation
- Document all collaboration activities for review
- Conduct regular retrospectives on collaboration effectiveness
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open

### RISK-PERSEUS-004 - Open
**Description**: The Perseus initialization effort may expand beyond defined boundaries, affecting timeline and resource allocation.
**Mitigation**: 
- Define clear boundaries for Perseus initialization
- Use vertical slicing approach with defined acceptance criteria
- Regular review of progress against PLAN.md
- Prioritize based on value and impact
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open

### RISK-PERSEUS-005 - Open
**Description**: Dependencies on external tools or libraries for the Perseus framework may introduce vulnerabilities or maintenance challenges.
**Mitigation**: 
- Use established, maintained libraries and platforms
- Keep dependencies up to date with latest stable versions
- Implement automated security scanning
- Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open

### RISK-PERSEUS-006 - Open
**Description**: Teams may resist adopting the Perseus framework due to learning curve or perceived complexity.
**Mitigation**: 
- Engage stakeholders early in the process
- Provide clear value proposition for Perseus framework
- Create comprehensive training materials
- Establish feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Follow the comprehensive risk mitigation strategy in `.perseus/risk-register/project-risks.md`
**Status**: Open
