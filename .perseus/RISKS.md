# RISKS

This document tracks identified risks and their mitigations.

## Risk Format

Each risk should be documented with the following information:

- **Risk ID**: RISK-XXX (sequential numbering)
- **Title**: Brief descriptive title
- **Description**: Detailed description of the risk
- **Impact**: High/Medium/Low
- **Likelihood**: High/Medium/Low
- **Mitigation**: Steps to reduce the risk
- **Owner**: Person responsible for monitoring
- **Status**: Open/Closed/Mitigated

## Risks

| Risk ID | Title | Impact | Likelihood | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| RISK-001 | Instruction set may be unclear or ambiguous | High | Medium | Mitigated |
| RISK-002 | Instruction set may not cover important scenarios | High | Medium | Mitigated |
| RISK-003 | Instruction set may become outdated | Medium | High | Open |
| RISK-004 | Adoption of instruction set may be low | Medium | High | Open |
| RISK-005 | Specialized domain knowledge may be insufficient | Medium | Medium | Mitigated |
| RISK-006 | Instruction set may be difficult to navigate | Medium | High | Mitigated |
| RISK-007 | Instruction set may not comply with standards | Medium | Medium | Mitigated |

## Risk Mitigation Details

### RISK-001 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set was initially missing detailed guidance for specialized domains.
**Mitigation**: Created domain-specific guardrails for DATABASE, PERFORMANCE, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_PRIVACY, API_DESIGN, INFRASTRUCTURE, MAINTENANCE, and COMPLIANCE. Organized guardrails by functional roles for easier navigation.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-002 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set did not cover important scenarios in specialized software development domains.
**Mitigation**: Expanded coverage to include comprehensive guardrails for all major software development domains, ensuring AI contributors have explicit guidance for specialized scenarios.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-005 - Mitigated
**Description**: The expanded guardrail set might lack sufficient depth in specialized domains due to insufficient domain expertise.
**Mitigation**: Created additional guardrails for TESTING, VERSION_CONTROL, CONTAINERIZATION, CLOUD, MICROSERVICES, APPLICATION_SECURITY, DATA_ENGINEERING, WEB, and CODE_REVIEW domains, providing comprehensive coverage across the software development landscape.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-006 - Mitigated
**Description**: With over 40 guardrail documents, the instruction set became difficult to navigate and maintain.
**Mitigation**: Restructured repository to organize guardrails by functional domains (development, marketing, design, hr, finance) with clear README files explaining each domain's purpose.
**Status**: Mitigated

### RISK-007 - Mitigated
**Description**: The instruction set did not fully comply with industry standards for technical specifications.
**Mitigation**: Implemented full compliance with RFC 2119 and OASIS Keyword Guidelines, ensuring all documents include proper conformance clauses and references. Created validation scripts to maintain compliance.
**Status**: Mitigated
