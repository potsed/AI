## Title
Risk Management for Perseus Initialization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Perseus framework initialization represents a significant undertaking that involves establishing comprehensive documentation, processes, and tools for Human-AI collaborative software development. This effort spans multiple domains including software development, security, documentation, and organizational change management. Given the complexity and scope of this initiative, proactive risk management is essential to ensure successful delivery.

The GUARDRAILS.md document establishes risk management as a core principle (section 18) requiring that "Risks and mitigations MUST be identified and documented." Additionally, the PROCESS.md document emphasizes the importance of identifying potential failure modes through pre-mortem analysis in the slice loop process.

The Perseus initialization plan outlines a four-phase approach over four weeks with specific milestones and deliverables. Each phase introduces potential risks that could impact the successful delivery of the framework.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive risk management approach for the Perseus initialization that includes:

1. **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification of potential risks across all phases of the initialization
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of risk impact and likelihood to prioritize mitigation efforts
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Development of specific strategies to address each identified risk
4. **Contingency Planning**: Preparation of backup plans for high-impact risks
5. **Monitoring and Review**: Ongoing tracking of risks and regular assessment of mitigation effectiveness
6. **Documentation**: Maintenance of a risk register with detailed mitigation strategies

This approach aligns with the principles established in GUARDRAILS.md and supports the Human-AI collaboration process defined in PROCESS.md.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues before they impact delivery
- Improved communication about risks and mitigation strategies across the team
- Enhanced documentation quality through systematic review processes
- Better resource allocation through risk-informed prioritization
- Increased likelihood of successful Perseus framework adoption

### Negative Consequences
- Additional overhead in terms of time and effort for risk management activities
- Potential for over-engineering risk mitigation strategies
- Risk of analysis paralysis if not carefully managed

### Neutral Consequences
- Establishment of risk management practices that can be applied to future initiatives
- Creation of reusable risk management artifacts and templates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Risk Identification and Assessment (Week 1)
1. Conduct comprehensive risk identification workshop with all stakeholders
2. Document all identified risks in the risk register
3. Assess impact and likelihood for each risk
4. Prioritize risks based on risk score (impact Ã— likelihood)

### Phase 2: Risk Mitigation Strategy Development (Week 1)
1. Develop specific mitigation strategies for each identified risk
2. Assign risk owners for ongoing monitoring
3. Create contingency plans for high-impact risks
4. Document mitigation strategies in the detailed risk register

### Phase 3: Implementation of Monitoring and Review Processes (Week 2)
1. Establish continuous monitoring activities for each risk
2. Schedule regular risk review meetings
3. Implement risk reporting mechanisms
4. Define roles and responsibilities for risk management

### Phase 4: Ongoing Risk Management Throughout Initialization (Weeks 2-4)
1. Execute continuous monitoring activities
2. Conduct regular risk review meetings
3. Update risk register based on project progress
4. Assess effectiveness of mitigation strategies

## Success Metrics
1. All identified risks documented with mitigation strategies (100%)
2. High-impact risks have contingency plans in place (100%)
3. Regular risk review meetings conducted as scheduled (100%)
4. No critical risks realized that significantly impact delivery
5. Risk management activities integrated into team retrospectives
