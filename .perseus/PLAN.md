# Plan

This document outlines the vertical slices for creating the instruction set.

## Slice Map

| Slice ID | Description | Outcome Links | Acceptance Criteria | Feature Flag |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| S1 | Define core Human-AI collaboration workflow | O1, O2 | - Workflow is clearly documented in PROCESS.md<br>- Process includes explicit agreement between human and AI<br>- Process is validated with example scenarios | ff_collab_workflow |
| S2 | Define security validation for AI contributions | O2 | - Security requirements are documented in GUARDRAILS.md<br>- Process includes automated security checks<br>- Guidelines for secrets management are defined | ff_security_validation |
| S3 | Define documentation generation for AI contributions | O3 | - Documentation requirements are specified<br>- Process for maintaining up-to-date docs is defined<br>- ADR template and process are established | ff_doc_generation |

## Priority Order

1. S1 - Core Human-AI collaboration workflow
2. S2 - Security validation for AI contributions
3. S3 - Documentation generation for AI contributions

## Dependencies

- S2 and S3 depend on S1 as they build on the core collaboration workflow
