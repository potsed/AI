## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by functional domains:

### Root Directory
Contains general framework documents:
- AI.md - Core AI compliance requirements
- GUARDRAILS.md - General guardrails
- PROCESS.md - Human-AI collaboration process
- PURPOSE.md - Project purpose and goals
- README.md - General information
- RFC2119.md - Overview of all RFC2119 requirements
- RFC2119_PROCESS.md - RFC2119 requirements for Human-AI process

### Development Directory (`development/`)
Contains 40+ guardrails for software development:
- Core development (DATABASE.md, API_DESIGN.md, WEB.md, DAEMONS.md, CLI.md, etc.)
- Architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md, MICROSERVICES.md)
- Security (APPLICATION_SECURITY.md, DATA_PRIVACY.md)
- Operations (CONTAINERIZATION.md, CLOUD.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
- Quality (TESTING.md, CODE_REVIEW.md)
- Process (VERSION_CONTROL.md)
- RFC2119_DEVELOPMENT.md - Complete RFC2119 requirements for all development guardrails

### Marketing Directory (`marketing/`)
Contains guardrails for marketing practices:
- MARKETING.md - Core marketing principles
- CONTENT_MARKETING.md - Content marketing practices
- DIGITAL_MARKETING.md - Digital marketing practices
- RFC2119_MARKETING.md - Complete RFC2119 requirements for all marketing guardrails

### Other Domain Directories
Placeholder directories for future expansion:
- `design/` - For design guardrails
- `hr/` - For human resources guardrails
- `finance/` - For finance guardrails

## Key Features

### RFC2119 Organization and Compliance
- Function-specific RFC2119 requirements for better usability
- Main RFC2119.md provides overview and links to function-specific files
- Each function has its own RFC2119 file with ALL relevant requirements from that domain
- **Full compliance with OASIS Keyword Guidelines and RFC 2119 standards**
- All documents include proper conformance clauses and references

### Validation
- Automated validation script ensures all guardrails have compliance sections
- Script checks RFC 2119 compliance across all functional domains
- Continuous validation of normative requirements

### Documentation
- Comprehensive ADRs documenting major decisions
- Clear README files for each directory explaining purpose
- Progress tracking in OUTCOMES.yaml

## Progress Metrics
- Overall project progress: 85%
- 40+ development guardrails created
- 3 marketing guardrails created
- Repository restructured for multi-domain support
- RFC2119 requirements organized by function
- **Full RFC 2119 and OASIS guidelines compliance achieved**

## What's Missing

### Additional Development Guardrails Needed
- Technology-specific (React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Mobile development (iOS/Android)
- Desktop applications
- IoT and embedded systems
- Blockchain development

### Additional Business Function Guardrails Needed
- Design guardrails (UX, visual design, etc.)
- HR guardrails (recruitment, performance management, etc.)
- Finance guardrails (accounting, procurement, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Continue expanding guardrails for additional technologies and business functions
2. Create guardrails for remaining business functions (design, HR, finance)
3. Develop technology-specific guardrails for popular frameworks and languages
4. Expand marketing guardrails to cover additional marketing disciplines
5. Continue updating progress metrics as work is completed
