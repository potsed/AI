# Human-AI Collaboration Prompts

This document contains standardized prompts for effective Human-AI collaboration within the Perseus framework.

## General Collaboration Prompts

### Explicit Agreement Process
```

- [Risk 2]

My confidence level for this approach is [X]%. [Explanation of confidence level]

Do you approve this approach?"
```

### Confidence-Based Decision Making
```
AI: "I recommend [recommendation]. My confidence level for this recommendation is [X]%.

Reasoning:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]

Limitations:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

Alternative options:
1. [Option 1] (Confidence: [X]%)
2. [Option 2] (Confidence: [X]%)"
```

### Knowledge Gap Acknowledgment
```
AI: "I notice you're asking about [topic]. While I have general knowledge about this area, I don't have specific expertise in [domain].

My limitations in this area:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
- [Limitation 3]

I recommend consulting with a [domain expert] or requesting a Subject Matter Expert in this area. In the meantime, I can provide general information about [topic]."
```

### Iterative Feedback Loop
```
AI: "I'll implement [task] in the following increments:

Week 1: [Increment 1]
- Check-in: [Date] for review
- Feedback integration: [Date]

Week 2: [Increment 2]
- Check-in: [Date] for review
- Feedback integration: [Date]

Week 3: [Increment 3]
- Check-in: [Date] for review
- Final validation: [Date]

At each check-in, please provide feedback on:
- [Feedback area 1]
- [Feedback area 2]
- [Feedback area 3]"
```

### Documentation-First Approach
```
AI: "Before implementing [feature], I'll create the following documentation:

1. ADR documenting the [decision]
2. README updates explaining the [implementation]
3. Code comments explaining [complex logic]
4. RUNBOOK entries for [operational procedures]

I'll share drafts of this documentation for review before finalizing the implementation."
```

## Task-Specific Prompts

### Code Implementation
```
Context: PURPOSE.md, OUTCOMES.yaml, PLAN.md
Task: Implement slice S{n} for outcomes [O1,O2]
Constraints: TDD, deterministic tests, no TODOs
Output: unified diff patch only + 5â€“7 line PR body

PR Body Template:
Problem: <short>
Approach: <short>
Tests: <evidence>
Risks: <top 2 + mitigations>
Links: PURPOSE/.perseus/OUTCOMES/.perseus/PLAN/S{n}
```

### Documentation Creation
```
Context: GUARDRAILS.md, PROCESS.md, RFC2119.md
Task: Create documentation for [topic]
Constraints: MUST follow RFC2119 format, include compliance sections
Output: Markdown document with proper structure and formatting
```

### Architecture Decision
```
Context: Existing ADRs, technical requirements
Task: Document decision for [architectural choice]
Constraints: MUST follow ADR template, include all required sections
Output: Complete ADR document with status, context, decision, and consequences
```

### Risk Assessment
```
Context: RISKS.md, project requirements
Task: Identify and document risks for [feature/component]
Constraints: MUST include impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies
Output: Risk documentation following the established format
```

## Review and Feedback Prompts

### Code Review
```
AI: "I've reviewed the code changes and have the following feedback:

Positive aspects:
- [Positive 1]
- [Positive 2]

Areas for improvement:
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

Compliance check:
- [GUARDRAILS.md compliance status]

```

## Retrospective Prompts

### Sprint Retrospective
```
AI: "Let's conduct our sprint retrospective. Here are some questions to guide our discussion:

1. What went well this sprint?
2. What didn't go well this sprint?
3. What can we improve for next sprint?
4. How effective was our Human-AI collaboration?
5. What patterns or anti-patterns did we observe?

Please share your thoughts on each of these areas."
```
