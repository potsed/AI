# 0001 - Human-AI Collaboration Workflow

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to establish a clear workflow for how humans and AI will collaborate during software development. Without a defined process, contributions may be inconsistent, and the quality of the code may suffer. We need to ensure that AI contributions are aligned with human expertise and project goals.

## Decision

We will implement the Human-AI collaboration workflow as defined in PROCESS.md, which includes:

1. Explicit agreement between human and AI before implementation
2. Test-driven development for all business logic
3. Refactoring to maintain code quality
4. Documentation updates with every change
5. Feature flagging for all new functionality
6. Retrospectives to continuously improve the process

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Easier
- Consistent, high-quality contributions from AI
- Better alignment between human expertise and AI capabilities
- Clear process for onboarding new team members (both human and AI)
- Improved code quality through TDD and refactoring
- Better documentation of decisions and changes

### More Difficult
- Initial overhead of establishing explicit agreements
- Need to maintain discipline in following the process
- Potential slower initial velocity as the team adapts to the workflow
