# 0004 - Expanded Guardrail Domain Coverage

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The initial HI/AI Policies framework provided comprehensive guardrails for core software development practices but lacked coverage in several specialized domains. As AI-assisted development expands to cover more specialized areas, there was a need to provide explicit guidance for these domains to ensure consistent, secure, and maintainable code generation across all software development disciplines.

The missing domains included specialized testing practices, version control workflows, containerization, cloud-native development, microservices architecture, application security, data engineering, web frontend development, and code review practices. Without explicit guardrails in these areas, AI contributors might generate code that doesn't follow best practices or meet quality standards specific to these domains.

## Decision

We have expanded the HI/AI Policies framework to include comprehensive guardrails for the following specialized domains:

1. **TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing strategies and practices
2. **VERSION_CONTROL.md** - Version control workflows and collaboration practices
3. **CONTAINERIZATION.md** - Containerization best practices and security
4. **CLOUD.md** - Cloud-native development principles and practices
5. **MICROSERVICES.md** - Microservices architecture patterns and implementation
6. **APPLICATION_SECURITY.md** - Application-level security requirements
7. **DATA_ENGINEERING.md** - Data engineering practices and pipelines
8. **WEB.md** - Web frontend development standards
9. **CODE_REVIEW.md** - Code review processes and standards

Each document follows the same mandatory format with explicit RFC2119 language and compliance requirements. All documents have been integrated into the existing framework structure and are discoverable through the updated README.md and organized in GUARDRAILS_BY_ROLE.md.

## Consequences

### Easier
- AI contributors have explicit guidance for specialized domains
- Consistent application of best practices across all software development disciplines
- Better coverage of security and quality requirements in specialized areas
- Improved maintainability through domain-specific standards
- Easier onboarding for AI contributors working in specialized areas

### More Difficult
- Increased maintenance overhead for the expanded set of documents
- Need for domain experts to review and validate specialized guardrails
- Potential for inconsistency between domain-specific and general guardrails
- Larger learning curve for AI contributors to understand all guardrails
