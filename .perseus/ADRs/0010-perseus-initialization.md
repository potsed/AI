# ADR 0010: Perseus Framework Initialization

## Context
We need to establish the Perseus framework as a comprehensive Human-AI collaboration system that enables secure, maintainable, and production-ready software development. This ADR documents the approach for initializing the Perseus framework while ensuring compliance with the HATS framework principles and all mandatory requirements.

## Decision
We will implement a structured initialization plan for Perseus that:

1. Establishes a clear directory structure following the HATS framework principles
2. Creates essential documentation artifacts for project management
3. Implements a phased approach to framework initialization
4. Ensures compliance with all guardrails and RFC2119 requirements
5. Establishes clear metrics for success measurement

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive
- Provides a structured approach to Human-AI collaboration
- Ensures compliance with security and quality standards
- Establishes clear documentation for framework usage
- Enables consistent implementation across projects
- Facilitates adoption through clear templates and guidelines

### Negative
- Requires initial investment in documentation creation
- May require training for team members
- Need for ongoing maintenance of framework artifacts
- Potential resistance to adopting new processes

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Documentation Approach
- Create only essential documents without comprehensive templates
- Pros: Faster initial implementation
- Cons: Less guidance for users, potential inconsistency

### Alternative 2: Tool-Centric Approach
- Focus primarily on automated tools rather than documentation
- Pros: Less manual documentation effort
- Cons: Less flexibility, harder to customize for specific needs

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation (Week 1)
   - Create PURPOSE.md with clear objectives
   - Update OUTCOMES.yaml with Perseus-specific outcomes
   - Document approach in this ADR
   - Update PLAN.md with Perseus initialization slices
   - Create project template

2. **Phase 2**: Structure and Documentation (Week 2)
   - Create SME template
   - Document Human-AI collaboration patterns and anti-patterns
   - Update RFC2119 inventory
   - Create project initialization checklist

3. **Phase 3**: Operational Framework (Week 3)
   - Update RUNBOOK.md with Perseus procedures
   - Create project risk register
   - Update RISKS.md with Perseus-specific risks
   - Create technology stack documentation
   - Create Human-AI collaboration prompts

4. **Phase 4**: Integration and Validation (Week 4)
   - Update all README.md files
   - Update SUMMARY.md with progress
   - Validate compliance with GUARDRAILS.md
   - Run validation scripts

## Validation
This approach will be validated through:
- Compliance checking against GUARDRAILS.md
- Peer review of documentation
- Testing of templates and processes
- Feedback from early adopters
