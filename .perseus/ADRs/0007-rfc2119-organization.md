# 0007 - RFC2119 Requirements Organization by Function

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The original RFC2119.md file contained all requirements mixed together, making it difficult to find function-specific requirements. As the framework expanded to cover multiple business functions (development, marketing, etc.), it became clear that organizing RFC2119 requirements by functional area would improve usability and maintainability.

Additionally, the Human-AI collaboration process requirements were mixed with technical development requirements, making it hard to distinguish between them.

## Decision

We have reorganized the RFC2119 requirements into function-specific files:

1. **RFC2119.md** - Main reference file that provides an overview and links to function-specific files
2. **development/RFC2119_DEVELOPMENT.md** - Contains all RFC2119 requirements specific to software development
3. **marketing/RFC2119_MARKETING.md** - Contains all RFC2119 requirements specific to marketing
4. **RFC2119_PROCESS.md** - Contains all RFC2119 requirements specific to the Human-AI collaboration process

Each function-specific RFC2119 file contains only the requirements relevant to that function, organized by logical categories. This makes it easier for practitioners to find the requirements that apply to their specific work.

## Consequences

### Easier
- Practitioners can easily find RFC2119 requirements relevant to their specific function
- Better organization makes the framework more approachable
- Easier to maintain and update function-specific requirements
- Clear separation between different types of requirements (technical, process, business)
- Reduced cognitive load when reviewing requirements for a specific function

### More Difficult
- Existing references to specific requirements in the original RFC2119.md may need updating
- Users need to understand the new organization structure
- Slight overhead in maintaining multiple RFC2119 files
- Need to ensure consistency across function-specific files
