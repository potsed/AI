# 0009 - Tigerstyle.dev Principles Integration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The tigerstyle.dev website provides valuable principles and practices for efficient and effective software development. These principles complement the existing HI/AI Policies framework by offering specific guidance on code optimization, early exit patterns, and other development best practices.

Key principles from tigerstyle.dev include:
1. **Exit Early Principle** - Minimizing unnecessary processing by exiting or returning as soon as possible
2. **Guard Clause Pattern** - Using early returns to handle exceptional cases and simplify main logic flow
3. **Assertion Usage** - Using assertions to catch programming errors and document assumptions
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Dividing programs into distinct sections addressing separate concerns
5. **Default Value Patterns** - Setting sensible defaults and overriding only when necessary
6. **Early Return Pattern** - Returning from functions as early as possible to simplify control flow
7. **Short-Circuit Evaluation** - Using logical operators that stop evaluation when result is determined
8. **Resource Management** - Acquiring and releasing resources as early as possible

## Decision

We will integrate tigerstyle.dev principles into the HI/AI Policies framework by:

1. **Creating a dedicated TIGERSTYLE.md file** in the development directory containing all principles with RFC2119 requirements
2. **Organizing principles by pattern categories** with detailed implementation guidelines
3. **Providing implementation examples** for each principle
4. **Including proper RFC2119 compliance** with benefits, drawbacks, and implementation guidelines
5. **Referencing these principles** in relevant development guardrails

Note: The TIGERSTYLE.md file was planned but never implemented. The principles from tigerstyle.dev have been integrated directly into the existing development guardrails instead.

## Consequences

### Easier
- Better code optimization with early exit patterns
- Improved readability with reduced nesting and complexity
- Better performance with minimized unnecessary processing
- Enhanced maintainability with clear control flow
- Better error handling with immediate failure response
- Improved resource utilization with early release
- Better debugging with assertion-based error detection

### More Difficult
- Requires additional development time to learn and implement
- Can complicate some complex conditional logic scenarios
- May require refactoring of existing code to apply principles
- Requires discipline to implement consistently across teams
- May conflict with some existing coding patterns

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Review existing code** for opportunities to apply early exit patterns
2. **Implement guard clauses** in functions with multiple exceptional conditions
3. **Add assertions** to document assumptions and catch programming errors
4. **Refactor nested conditionals** to use early returns
5. **Optimize resource management** with acquire-late/release-early patterns
6. **Use short-circuit evaluation** to prevent unnecessary computation
7. **Apply separation of concerns** to improve modularity
8. **Set sensible defaults** and override only when necessary
9. **Document principle usage** in code comments and documentation
10. **Train team members** on tigerstyle.dev principles and practices
