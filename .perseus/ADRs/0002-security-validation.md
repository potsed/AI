# 0002 - Security Validation for AI Contributions

## Status

Proposed

## Context

AI-assisted development introduces new security risks, as AI may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or commit secrets. We need a systematic approach to validate all AI contributions for security compliance before they are merged into the codebase.

## Decision

We will implement the following security validation measures for all AI contributions:

1. Automated scanning for secrets in all AI-generated code
2. Static application security testing (SAST) integrated into CI/CD pipeline
3. Dynamic application security testing (DAST) for web applications
4. Regular security reviews of AI contributions by human team members
5. Implementation of security guardrails in GUARDRAILS.md that AI must follow

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Easier
- Early detection of security vulnerabilities
- Prevention of secrets being committed to repositories
- Consistent application of security best practices
- Reduced risk of security incidents

### More Difficult
- Potential delays in merging AI contributions due to security checks
- Need for human review of AI contributions for security
- Implementation and maintenance of security scanning tools
- Balancing security with development velocity
