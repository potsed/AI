# 0003 - Documentation Generation for AI Contributions

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Documentation is critical for maintaining and understanding code, but it's often neglected in fast-paced development environments. With AI-assisted development, we have an opportunity to ensure that documentation is automatically generated and kept up-to-date with code changes.

## Decision

We will implement the following documentation practices for AI contributions:

1. Automatic generation of documentation for all API endpoints
2. Updates to README.md and other relevant documentation files with every code change
3. Creation of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant design decisions
4. Maintenance of runbooks for operational procedures
5. Generation of code comments for complex business logic

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Easier
- Keeping documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Onboarding new team members with comprehensive documentation
- Understanding the rationale behind design decisions
- Maintaining and operating the system with detailed runbooks

### More Difficult
- Initial setup of documentation generation tools
- Ensuring AI generates high-quality documentation
- Maintaining consistency in documentation style
- Balancing documentation generation with development velocity
