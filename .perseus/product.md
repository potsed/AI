# Perseus Framework Product Information

## Product Overview

The Perseus framework is a comprehensive Human-AI collaboration system that enables secure, maintainable, and production-ready software development through standardized processes, clear documentation, and effective AI-human teamwork. It builds upon the HATS (Human-AI Teamwork System) to provide a structured approach to Human-AI collaborative software development.

## Vision

To establish a standardized framework that enables effective collaboration between human Subject Matter Experts and AI assistants, resulting in higher quality software delivered faster while maintaining security and compliance standards.

## Mission

To provide a comprehensive set of tools, processes, and documentation that guide Human-AI teams through the software development lifecycle, ensuring consistent quality, security, and maintainability while maximizing the complementary strengths of human expertise and AI capabilities.
