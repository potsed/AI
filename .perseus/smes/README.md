# SMEs Directory

This directory contains autogenerated Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) `hired` by the ai_coordinator agent. These can be reused.

## Purpose
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are specialized AI agents with deep knowledge in specific domains. They serve as advisors and consultants within their area of expertise, providing accurate, up-to-date information and guidance.

## Types of SMEs
SMEs can be created for any subject area including:
- Technology domains (databases, programming languages, frameworks)
- Business domains (marketing, finance, operations)
- Specialized knowledge areas (legal, compliance, security)
- Creative domains (design, copywriting, content creation)
- Platform expertise (social media platforms, advertising platforms, cloud services)

## Examples
- `digital-marketing.md` - Expertise in digital marketing strategies and platforms
- `sqlite.md` - Expertise in SQLite database management

## Usage
SMEs are advisors only and cannot modify project files. They provide guidance based on official documentation and well-referenced sources. When an agent needs specialized knowledge in a specific domain, they can consult the relevant SME file.

## Creation
SMEs are created by the AI Coordinator in collaboration with the Research Analyst when requested by a Human Operator or another coordinator. All SMEs follow a standardized template format.
