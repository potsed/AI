# HATS Framework - Human-AI Teamwork System

## Overview
The HATS (Human-AI Teamwork System) framework is a comprehensive model for Human-AI collaborative software development that defines 32 distinct personas with specific roles, responsibilities, and RFC2119-based rulesets. Each persona represents a unique perspective and set of expertise that contributes to the overall success of software projects.

## What is HATS?

HATS stands for **Human-AI Teamwork System**. It's a framework that organizes software development collaboration around specialized personas, each with:

1. **Distinct Roles**: Clear responsibilities and areas of expertise
2. **RFC2119-Based Rulesets**: Specific requirements that define what each persona MUST, SHOULD, and MAY do
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Specialized understanding of their functional area
4. **Collaboration Patterns**: Defined ways of working with other personas

## The Five External Forces

The HATS framework recognizes five external forces that influence product development:

1. **Investor Force** - Investors, Shareholders, Boards
2. **Business Force** - Executives, Presidents, Business Leaders
3. **Customer Force** - Purchasers, Users, Contracts, Clients
4. **Supplier Force** - Staff, Suppliers, Materials, Services
5. **Regulatory Force** - Legal, Taxes, Regulatory Bodies

These forces provide input that the Product Custodian must synthesize and balance.

## The Internal Development Personas

The HATS framework defines 32 core internal personas that handle the actual development work:

## Domain Consolidation Approach

As part of the HATS framework implementation, all domain-specific requirements from directories such as `/development`, `/marketing`, `/architecture`, etc. have been consolidated into the persona profiles themselves. This approach:

1. **Eliminates Redundancy**: All relevant information from domain directories is incorporated into persona rulesets
2. **Improves Accessibility**: Team members can find all relevant requirements for a role in one place
3. **Ensures Completeness**: Each persona profile contains all necessary RFC2119 requirements for their domain
4. **Facilitates Role-Based Guidance**: Team members can focus on the personas relevant to their work
5. **Enables Better Collaboration**: Personas reference each other's requirements for cross-functional work

Each persona profile now includes:
- Comprehensive RFC2119-based rulesets
- Domain-specific knowledge areas
- Related design patterns
- Collaboration guidelines with other personas
- Key responsibilities

## How the Personas Work Together

### Information Flow
```
External Forces → Product Custodian → AI Personas → Implementation → Feedback Loop
```

### Collaboration Mechanisms
1. **Perspective Sharing**: Each AI persona provides input based on their expertise
2. **Conflict Identification**: System highlights disagreements between personas
3. **Synthesis Process**: Product Custodian evaluates all inputs
4. **Decision Communication**: Clear direction to implementing personas
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Continuous feedback on implementation status

### Ruleset Integration
Each persona operates within their defined ruleset based on RFC2119 standards:
- **MUST** requirements are mandatory
- **SHOULD** recommendations are strongly advised
- **MAY** options are discretionary
- **MUST NOT** prohibitions are strictly forbidden

Personas can flag when requests conflict with their principles, and there are established protocols for cross-persona collaboration.

## Human-AI Collaboration Framework

The HATS framework implements a robust Human-AI collaboration model where:

1. **Humans act as Product Custodians**, making final decisions and providing domain expertise
2. **AI agents serve as specialized personas**, contributing their expertise within defined rulesets
3. **Explicit agreement processes** ensure alignment before implementation
4. **Confidence levels** are provided with all recommendations
5. **Knowledge gaps** are explicitly identified and documented
6. **Human corrections** are captured and learned from

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Each persona has well-defined responsibilities
2. **Standardized Communication**: RFC2119-based rulesets ensure consistent expectations
3. **Balanced Decision Making**: Multiple perspectives are considered in decisions
4. **Specialized Expertise**: Each persona brings deep knowledge in their domain
5. **Scalable Collaboration**: Framework can accommodate additional personas as needed
6. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in checks and balances improve outcomes
7. **Centralized Information**: All domain knowledge consolidated in persona profiles
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from human corrections enhances AI capabilities

## Usage Guidelines

These persona profiles should be used to:

1. **Guide AI Behavior**: Each AI agent can be configured to follow the ruleset of a specific persona
2. **Define Role Expectations**: Team members understand what each role is responsible for
3. **Facilitate Collaboration**: Clear guidelines on how personas work together
4. **Ensure Compliance**: RFC2119-based rulesets provide clear requirements
5. **Support Training**: New team members can learn role expectations from these profiles
6. **Centralize Information**: All domain-specific knowledge is in one accessible location

## Maintenance

Persona profiles should be:

- **Reviewed regularly** for accuracy and relevance
- **Updated** based on evolving role requirements
- **Aligned** with project guardrails and RFC2119 documents
- **Validated** through real-world application
- **Enhanced** with new examples and use cases
