# AI Development Framework

This document provides an overview of the AI-assisted software development framework used in this repository. All AI contributors MUST read and comprehend the following documents before making any contributions:

## Core Documents

### [PROCESS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/potsed/AI/refs/heads/main/PROCESS.md) - Human-AI Software Delivery Process
This document defines the iterative process for Human-AI co-development. It outlines the step-by-step workflow from initialization through release, including:
- How to define purpose and product outcomes
- Planning vertical slices of work
- The slice loop implementation process (clarify, test, implement, refactor, document, integrate, demo)
- Review and release cycles
- Artifact management
- Prompt and PR templates

### [GUARDRAILS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/potsed/AI/refs/heads/main/GUARDRAILS.md) - AI Guardrails
This document defines non-negotiable rules for how AI assistants and contributors MUST propose, design, implement, test, review, document, and release software in this repository. Key areas include:
- Core principles (libraries first, custom code only for business logic, ATOMIC code)
- TDD requirements and testing standards
- Security and error handling policies
- Supply chain and dependency management
- Observability and documentation requirements
- Legal and regulatory compliance
- CI/CD enforcement and PR checklists
