### Domain Consolidation Implemented ✅
As requested, we have established a complete domain consolidation approach that:
- Moves all domain-specific content from separate directories into persona profiles
- Eliminates redundant directories like `/development`, `/marketing`, etc.
- Centralizes information in role-based persona profiles
- Maintains RFC2119 compliance across all consolidated content

## Key Features and Benefits

### 1. Comprehensive Role Coverage ✅
All critical aspects of software development, business operations, and specialized domains are addressed through 32 distinct personas.

### 2. Standardized Communication ✅
RFC2119-based rulesets ensure consistent expectations and clear requirements for all personas.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration Framework ✅
Defined information flow patterns, conflict resolution mechanisms, and decision-making processes.

### 4. Human-AI Integration ✅
Explicit agreement processes, confidence level reporting, and knowledge gap identification enable effective Human-AI collaboration.

### 5. Domain Consolidation ✅
Eliminated redundancy by moving all domain-specific requirements into persona profiles, improving accessibility and maintainability.

### 6. Quality Assurance ✅
Built-in checks and balances through validation requirements improve outcomes.

## Conclusion

The HATS framework is now complete with 32 distinct personas covering all critical aspects of software development, business operations, and specialized domains. The addition of The Reporter persona and the domain consolidation approach address your requirements for centralizing all domain-specific information while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all necessary roles and responsibilities.

The framework provides a robust foundation for Human-AI collaborative software development that leverages the strengths of both humans and AI while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities. By defining distinct personas with specific rulesets and collaboration patterns, and consolidating all domain-specific information into persona profiles, the framework enables more effective teamwork and higher quality outcomes.

With the completion of the content migration and directory cleanup, the HATS framework provides an integrated, efficient, and effective approach to Human-AI teamwork in software development.
